  "query": "Project: Java Console ``Task Management Syste'' \n\nThis is a command-line task management application, similar to a lightweight \"to-do list manager,\" but gradually enhanced with more complex features until it becomes a complete system supporting concurrency, persistence, and search indexing. \n\nSubtask 1 — User Registration & Login \nDescription: Implement a command-line user system. \n- Support user registration (username + password), stored in a local file. \n- After login, the user enters the main menu. \nRun: \ncd workspace \njavac -d bin task1/*.java \njava -cp bin Main \nSuccess Criteria: Able to register a new user, exit the program, and log in again with the same credentials. \n\nSubtask 2 — Basic Task Management \nDescription: Extend Task 1 with task management. \n- After login, the user can add, delete, and view tasks. \n- Each task includes: Task ID, Title, Description, Creation Time, Status (Pending/Completed). \n- Task information is stored in files (separate for each user). \nRun: \ncd workspace \njavac -d bin task2/*.java \njava -cp bin Main \nSuccess Criteria: Able to create tasks, mark them as completed, and tasks persist across program restarts. \n\nSubtask 3 — Advanced Task Attributes + Categorization \nDescription: Extend the task system. \n- Each task supports priority (High/Medium/Low), deadline, and tags (multiple tags). \n- Users can filter/sort the task list by priority, deadline, or tags. \n- Provide command-line commands: /filter priority=high, /sort deadline. \nRun: \ncd workspace \njavac -d bin task3/*.java \njava -cp bin Main \nSuccess Criteria: Able to create tasks with priority and tags, and filter/sort them via commands. \n\nSubtask 4 — Global Search & Task Archiving \nDescription: Extend with global search and archiving. \n- Implement full-text search: input a keyword to search across all task titles/descriptions. \n- Completed tasks can be archived. Archived tasks no longer appear in the default list but remain searchable. \n- Search must support fuzzy matching (case-insensitive, partial matching). \nRun: \ncd workspace \njavac -d bin task4/*.java \njava -cp bin Main \nSuccess Criteria: Entering /search meeting should find tasks containing \"Meeting,\" including archived ones. \n\nSubtask 5 — Concurrency & Consistency: Multi-User Operation \nDescription: The most challenging part, extending Task 4 with concurrency. \n- The system supports multiple users logging in concurrently (running in multiple console windows, sharing the same database file). \n- Use file locks or synchronization mechanisms to ensure data consistency (avoid race conditions). \n- Support real-time refresh: when one user adds a task, other logged-in users can see the latest content after refreshing their list. \nRun: \ncd workspace \njavac -d bin task5/*.java \n# Open multiple terminals, run: \njava -cp bin Main --user alice \njava -cp bin Main --user bob \nSuccess Criteria: Multiple users can operate on the shared task database simultaneously without data loss or conflicts, and all users can see the latest consistent data."
