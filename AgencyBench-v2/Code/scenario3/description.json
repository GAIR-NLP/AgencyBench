    "subtask1": "You need to modify the files in this repository according to the requirements below. During the analysis process, do not directly read the complete file; try to read the first 10 lines using head or use grep instead. You are NOT allowed to directly run scripts, such as python, pip install, dockerfile, etc.\n\nThe repository requires enhancements to improve documentation clarity and extend vector storage capabilities. First, update the RetrieveChat notebook and installation documentation to eliminate confusion about package relationships and provide clearer environment setup guidance for both venv and conda users. The documentation should explicitly clarify that this project is not a subpackage of FLAML and streamline the onboarding process for new users.\n\nNext, implement support for Qdrant as an additional vector store option by creating a new agent class that extends the existing retrieve user proxy agent functionality. This new integration should be placed in the contrib directory alongside other retrieve agents. The implementation should leverage the existing retrieval utilities while adding Qdrant-specific connection and query logic.\n\nAdditionally, resolve compatibility issues with the ChromaDB integration by adapting to recent class renames in version 0.4.15. The fix should ensure proper collection creation when no client is explicitly provided.\n\nFinally, update the CI workflow configuration and package dependencies to include Qdrant testing requirements, ensuring that the new functionality can be properly validated in automated testing pipelines. The example documentation should also be updated to reflect these new capabilities and provide clearer guidance for users."
