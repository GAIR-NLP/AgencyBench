What are the key differences, technological requirements, and future implications of each approach?\n\nRequirements:\n1. Issue high-quality web queries and collect 5–10 distinct sources that cover academic papers, technical blog posts, industry or market reports, and research-institute updates released within the last three years.\n2. For each source capture: title, publisher/author, publication date, URL, content type (paper/blog/report/etc.), a concise summary (2–4 sentences), and the key insights that are relevant to the guiding question.\n3. Consolidate all findings into a single JSON array saved at workspace/web_info.json. The file must be valid UTF-8 JSON and adhere to the structure:\n[\n  {\n    \"title\": \"...\",\n    \"source_type\": \"paper|blog|report|other\",\n    \"publisher\": \"...\",\n    \"published_at\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n    \"url\": \"https://...\",\n    \"summary\": \"...\",\n    \"key_points\": [\"point1\", \"point2\"],\n    \"notes_for_report\": \"How this source will inform the later research report\"\n  }\n]\n4. Cite only trustworthy materials; if a claim cannot be supported by a captured source, discard it.\n5. When you finish writing web_info.json, explicitly state in the chat that you are waiting for the next instructions so the evaluator keeps the sii-agent-sdk session alive.\n",
    "subtask2": "Continue within the same sii-agent-sdk conversation used in Subtask 1. Read workspace/web_info.json plus your own domain knowledge to answer once more:\n\nHow should the development of generative AI evolve: focusing on dialogue-based systems (Chat) or autonomous action-taking systems (Agent)? What are the key differences, technological requirements, and future implications of each approach?\n\nRequirements:\n1. Generate a structured research report (recommended length ≤900 words) that restates the research question verbatim, outlines methodology/assumptions, compares Chat vs Agent systems, details current capabilities and technological requirements, and discusses future implications.\n2. Reference every factual statement with IEEE-style inline citations ([1], [2], …) that map to sources listed in a \"References\" section. Prefer the sources captured in workspace/web_info.json and supplement them only with well-known background knowledge if necessary.\n3. Output the final report to workspace/ResearchSystem_ChatVsAgent.json using the exact structure:\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 46,\n    \"question\": \"How should the development of generative AI evolve: focusing on dialogue-based systems (Chat) or autonomous action-taking systems (Agent)? What are the key differences, technological requirements, and future implications of each approach?\",\n    \"response\": \"[Complete research report content including the restated research question and IEEE references]\"\n  }\n]\n4. Ensure the JSON is valid and escaped properly. After saving the file, confirm completion in the chat and remain available until the evaluator ends the run."
