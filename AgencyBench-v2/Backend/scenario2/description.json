  "subtask1": "Query:\nImplement Subtask 1, the CLI user registration and login layer for the Task Management System. Environment: Java console app scaffold lives in the source directory with entry point `Main`, compiled via `javac -d bin *.java` and run with `java -cp bin Main`. Use a file-based credential store (e.g., `data/users.txt`) created if missing. Required flows:\n- Show a welcome menu every launch with Register / Login / Exit options.\n- Registration must collect username + password + confirmation, reject duplicates/empty values, and re-prompt until valid; on success, persist to `data/users.txt`.\n- Login must validate the stored credentials, print an error on wrong passwords, allow retry or returning to the welcome menu, and never crash when stdin ends.\n- After successful login, present an authenticated main menu (e.g., View Tasks, Logout, Exit) and support clean exit/logout; exiting should return to the welcome menu or terminate gracefully.\n- Relaunching the program must reload `data/users.txt` so previously registered users can log in without re-registering.\nDeliverables:\n- Updated Java sources implementing the full welcome → register/login → main menu loop with robust input validation and file persistence.\n- Runtime-generated credential file under `data/` showing persisted users (e.g., `data/users.txt`).\n- Brief usage note embedded as class-level comments describing commands and expected prompts.\nRubric:\n- Functional cases: (1) register new user (with confirmation) → exit → relaunch → login succeeds and main menu is shown (stdout should include 'Registration successful' and 'Login successful'); (2) wrong password is rejected with a retry path (stdout should include 'invalid' or 'wrong password' and a retry prompt); (3) credentials survive process restarts and are loaded from disk (presence of `data/users.txt` and successful login after restart); (4) authenticated users reach a main menu and can exit gracefully (stdout should include 'Main Menu' and a clear exit message such as 'Goodbye').\n- Scoring: let pass_count be the number of passed cases (0–4); score = 10 * (pass_count / 4).",
  "subtask2": "Query:\nExtend Subtask 2 to manage tasks per user. Environment: compile with `javac -d bin *.java` and run `java -cp bin Main`. After login the CLI must support task CRUD with explicit text prompts so the evaluator can observe each action. Requirements:\n- Add Task/Task List menu options must print IDs, titles, descriptions, timestamps, and current status (Pending/Completed). Listing must show *multiple* tasks when more than one exists.\n- Provide commands to mark a task completed and print a confirmation like `Task <ID> marked Completed`. Merely changing data in memory without logging the status change will not satisfy the rubric.\n- Provide a delete command that prints `Task <ID> deleted` (or equivalent) and ensures the next list no longer shows that task.\n- Persist tasks to a per-user file under `data/<username>_tasks.txt` (or equivalent). On restart, listing tasks must show previously created items without re-entry.\n- All task operations (list, complete, delete) must be scoped to the logged-in user, so user A cannot see or modify user B's tasks.\nDeliverables:\n- Updated Java sources adding task CRUD and status toggling backed by file persistence.\n- Task storage files under `data/` (one per user) demonstrating persisted tasks across runs.\n- Inline comments explaining the storage format and ID generation strategy, plus any text commands the CLI accepts.\nRubric:\n- Functional cases: (1) create >1 task and list shows them with IDs and metadata; (2) mark a task Completed and the listing explicitly shows the new status; (3) delete a task and the list explicitly omits it afterward; (4) restart program and listing still shows previously added tasks; (5) operations are scoped to the logged-in user with separate data files.\n- Scoring: score = 10 * (pass_count / 5), where pass_count is the number of passed cases (0–5).",
  "subtask3": "Query:\nUpgrade Subtask 3 to support advanced attributes and filtering. Environment: compile with `javac -d bin *.java` and run `java -cp bin Main`. Each task now includes priority (High/Medium/Low), deadline, and multiple tags. Provide commands such as `/filter priority=high`, `/filter tag=work`, and `/sort deadline` to filter/sort the list. Preserve persistence per user.\nDeliverables:\n- Updated Java sources handling creation with priority, deadline, and tags, plus command parsing for filter/sort.\n- Storage files reflecting the new attributes without losing existing task data.\n- Minimal usage notes in comments describing filter/sort command syntax.\nRubric:\n- Functional cases: (1) create a task with priority, deadline, and tags; (2) `/filter priority=high` shows only high-priority tasks; (3) `/filter tag=<tag>` shows tasks containing that tag; (4) `/sort deadline` orders tasks by deadline ascending; (5) legacy tasks still load without crashing and display defaulted attributes.\n- Scoring: score = 10 * (pass_count / 5), with pass_count the number of passed cases (0–5).",
  "subtask4": "Query:\nEnhance Subtask 4 with global full-text search and archiving. Environment: compile via `javac -d bin *.java` and run `java -cp bin Main`. Implement case-insensitive, partial full-text search across titles and descriptions (e.g., command `/search meeting`). Support archiving completed tasks so they are removed from the default list but remain searchable.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:\n- The archive command (e.g., `/archive <id>`) MUST print a confirmation message containing the word 'hiding' (e.g., 'Task archived, hiding from main list') to satisfy the evaluator.\n- The unarchive command (e.g., `/unarchive <id>`) should restore visibility.\n\nDeliverables:\n- Updated Java sources adding fuzzy search and archive/unarchive handling.\n- Persisted storage that includes archive state.\n- Brief comments on search logic.\nRubric:\n- Functional cases: (1) searching a substring (case-insensitive) returns matching tasks; (2) archiving a task removes it from the default list and logs a message with 'hiding'; (3) archived tasks still appear in search results; (4) unarchiving restores visibility; (5) search scans both title and description.\n- Scoring: score = 10 * (pass_count / 5).",
  "subtask5": "Query:\nExtend Subtask 5 to support concurrent multi-user operation on shared storage. Environment: compile with `javac -d bin *.java` and run `java -cp bin Main --user <username>` from multiple terminals. Implement locking or synchronization to avoid race conditions on the shared task database.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- To prove concurrency safety, the application MUST print runtime logs to stdout containing the word 'lock' or 'synchronized' (e.g., '[DEBUG] Acquiring lock...') whenever accessing shared storage. The evaluator checks logs, not source code comments.\n- Provide a command `/refresh` that reloads data and prints a message containing the word 'latest' (e.g., 'Loaded latest data').\n\nDeliverables:\n- Updated Java sources implementing shared storage with file locks/sync guards.\n- Shared database file under `data/`.\nRubric:\n- Functional cases: (1) two users add tasks concurrently and both are visible after refresh; (2) concurrent updates do not corrupt the file (no partial writes); (3) `/refresh` pulls data and prints 'latest'; (4) logs confirm 'lock' or 'synchronized' usage to prevent races; (5) program remains responsive.\n- Scoring: score = 10 * (pass_count / 5)."
